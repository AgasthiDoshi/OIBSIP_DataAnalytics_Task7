# Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to detect fraudulent financial
transactions using machine learning techniques. The project focuses
on identifying unusual patterns in transaction data to distinguish
between legitimate and fraudulent behavior.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Steps Performed
- Loaded and explored the transaction dataset
- Analyzed class imbalance between fraud and non-fraud cases
- Applied feature scaling to improve model performance
- Built a Logistic Regression model for fraud detection
- Evaluated model performance using precision, recall, and confusion matrix
- Interpreted results considering imbalanced data characteristics

## Outcome & Learnings
- Fraud detection datasets are highly imbalanced
- Accuracy alone is not sufficient for evaluating fraud models
- Logistic Regression provides a strong baseline for fraud detection
- Handling class imbalance improves detection effectiveness

- `Task7_Fraud_Detection.ipynb` – Main notebook
- `creditcard.csv` – Dataset used for fraud detection
